**E**veryone wants their property to look its best. Here are some suggestions for getting your property ready to look its best and make the photo shoot go smoothly. Many of these things also apply to making sure your home shows well to potential buyers.  
- The photo-shoot will take approximately 2 hours.
- I will be photographing both the inside and outside of the home.
- I’ll be photographing all of the major rooms.
- If there are special features of the home that are not obvious please let me know about these so I can include them in the shoot.
- Let me know if the home contains valuable works of art. I can edit photos to make these items unrecognizable.
## General Prep
- **Be shoot-ready**: Cleaning and staging needs to be done before I arrive, preferably the day
before your photoshoot. I may move small items (flowers, small pictures, etc.) to improve photo
composition, but larger items need to be in place before I arrive, and staging accessories need to be
in place as well.
- **Secure or remove pets**: I love pets but we can’t have them around for your photoshoot. Dogs
must be secured or off the property to ensure the safety of myself and my equipment. MLS rules also
prohibit people and pets from being in pictures. Cats should be secured as well, although they usually
pose fewer problems than dogs (cats often just hide). It's also a good idea to hide pet food and water
bowls as well.
- **Plan not to be seen**: All occupants should plan on either being off the property or remain in
areas where they can't be seen during the photoshoot. Rooms overlap in the photos, people can
cause shadows and reflections, and there is risk to equipment that will be setup throughout the
property.
- **Use the garage for storage**: I normally don’t shoot garages, unless it has special features, so this is a great place to store
items you’d like to hide
## Outside Prep
- **Clear the cars**: Make sure no cars are in the driveway. If possible, also move cars from the
street in front of the home. We want as clear a view as possible of your property.
- **Hide trashcans**: Trashcans can be placed on the side of the property or in the garage.
- **Hide hoses**: Do this the day before the shoot since hoses can drip water onto the pavement
when being moved, leaving puddles in your pictures.
- **Prep the yard**: Do at least 24 hours prior to your photoshoot. Yard should me mowed and
cleared of any toys, tools, etc. Sweep driveways, sidewalks, and patios.
- **Turn off sprinklers**: Do not water the day of the shoot to prevent puddles on pavement.
- **Pick up poop**: If you have a dog, make sure that all of their droppings are cleared from the yard.
- **Prep pool and spa**: If you have a pool and/or spa, please have them clean with covers
removed. For spas, provide instructions to the realtor on how to turn it on.
- **Prep water features**: If you have fountains, waterfalls, etc., please clean them and provide
instructions to the realtor on how to turn them on.
- **Remove for-sale sign**: The for-sale sign should be removed from the property (if possible) by
the realtor if it has already been installed. Visible signs violate MLS photo rules, and they can’t always
be edited out. It’s best to schedule sign installation for after the photoshoot.
- **Clean patio furniture**: Dust and remove cobwebs from all outdoor furniture. Do not hose down
your furniture the day of your shoot, since this can create puddles.
## Inside Prep
- **Declutter kitchen**: A few items on the counters are usually fine, but dishes, sponges, rags, etc.
should be put away. It's best to remove all magnets, pictures, etc. from the refrigerator and remove
throw rugs from the floor.
- **Declutter bathrooms**: Toothpaste, toothbrushes, razors, and other "personal" items should be
hidden. Decorative unused soaps, candles, flowers, etc. are preferred. It’s also good to remove all
throw rugs from the floor.
- **Prep bedrooms**: All bedrooms should have their beds made and items put away.
- **Hide trashcans**: Trashcans can distract so it’s best to hide all of them in closets or the garage.
- **Hide portable fans**: Ceiling fans are selling items but portable fans can give the wrong
impression. It’s best to hide all portable fans in closets or the garage.
- **Hide cords and remotes**: Sometimes electrical cords can’t be hidden, but you will have more
appealing pictures if you can hide TV remotes, game consoles, and any noticeable cords.
- **Clear entryways**: Remove all shoes, umbrellas, and similar items from entryways.
- **Open blinds with views**: Your indoor photos will show outdoor views if there are views, or just
light if a window looks onto a neighbor or other unappealing view.
- **Turn on lights**: Before I arrive, please make sure all interior lights are turned on. If need-be,
please replace all burned-out bulbs at least 24 hours before the photoshoot.
- **Turn off ceiling fans**: Before I arrive, please make sure all ceiling fans are turned off.
## Twilight Prep
If you’ve scheduled a twilight shoot the following are additional items to prepare before I arrive. Note
that twilights have tight schedules to ensure optimal lighting, so please make sure all of these items
are ready before I arrive.
- **Turn on all interior and exterior lights**: All lights throughout the property need to be turned
on. Please replace all burned-out bulbs at least 24 hours before the photoshoot.
- **Turn on spas and remove covers**: If you have a spa, remove the cover, and turn it before I
arrive. Turn on the lights in the spa as well.
- **Turn on pool lights**: If you have a pool, turn on the pool lights before I arrive.
- **Turn on water features**: If you have fountains, waterfalls, or similar water features, please turn
them on before I arrive.

Thank you for your time and patience to go through this checklist! If you have any questions, please
