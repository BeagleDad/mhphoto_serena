## Aerial Drone Photography: $100 with photo shoot / \$120 stand alone
Aerial images of home from front and rear at low altitude and high altitude. This includes 12 finished photos.
## Twilight shoot or repeat visit for exterior shots: \$100
Twilight shots are done between sunset and approximately 40 minutes after sunset. All lights in the home should be turned on and there may be added lighting. Twilight shots give a dramatic and elegant look to the home.
## Additional Image editing: \$60/hr
Image editing allows items like cars and garbage cans to be removed from driveways and make other improvements to photos. I do not change any of the permanent physical characteristics of the home with image editing.
